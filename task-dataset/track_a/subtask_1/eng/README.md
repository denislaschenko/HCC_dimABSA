Laptop and Restaurant Datasets
Both datasets are constructed by annotating valence and arousal (VA) values on the ACOS dataset (Cai et al., 2021). Participants can use these datasets for model training across all subtasks (DimASR, DimASTE, DimASQP) based on different combinations of the annotated elements.

Note: The training sets retain implicit aspects/opinions with NULL annotations from the original ACOS dataset. However, the test set to be released on December 1 will not include such implicit NULL annotations.
